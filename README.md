# Clustering

**Overview: **

This project demonstrates the use of clustering techniques on a dataset to group similar data points. 
Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning that is commonly used for exploratory data analysis 
and can be applied to various domains such as market segmentation, social network analysis, and 
image recognition. 

**Objectives: **

• To apply different clustering algorithms on a dataset. 
• To visualize the clusters and understand the underlying data structure. 
• To evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the clustering methods used.

**Results: **

The project provides visual and analytical insights into how different clustering algorithms perform 
on the dataset. Each algorithm's clusters are plotted and compared to understand the data structure 
and algorithmic performance. 


**Conclusion: **

The project highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each clustering method and provides a 
comprehensive understanding of how to apply and evaluate clustering techniques in practical 
scenarios.
